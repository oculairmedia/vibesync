# Beads/Dolt migration findings

Date: 2026-05-11

## Executive summary

Vibesync currently treats 98 registered projects as Beads-backed. They are not all in the same operational state:

- 51 projects already have a clean local Dolt/server-backed `.beads` store.
- 31 projects have a local `.beads` directory but are legacy SQLite / `beads.db` stores or otherwise do not present the clean Dolt/server metadata shape.
- 15 registry entries advertise Beads but their configured filesystem path has no local `.beads` directory.
- 1 registry entry advertises Beads but has no filesystem path.

Yes: we should migrate this in stages. DoltHub does not replace local Beads/Dolt. The `bd` CLI still reads and writes the project-local `.beads` store; DoltHub is only a remote for push/pull backup and collaboration.

## Key findings

### Local `.beads` remains the source of truth

For Beads-backed projects, normal agent work should use project-local commands such as:

```bash
bd ready --json
bd show <id> --json
bd update <id> --claim
bd close <id> --reason="..."
bd dolt push
```

Those commands depend on the local `.beads` directory, not just on Vibesync registry metadata and not just on DoltHub.

### DoltHub is a remote, not the runtime database

DoltHub remote state matters for durability, but it is not a substitute for a healthy local `.beads/dolt` checkout. A project can have a DoltHub remote configured and still fail local work if:

- `/usr/local/bin/dolt` is missing in the runtime/container.
- `.beads` files are owned by `root` when the worker runs as uid `1000` / `mcp-user`.
- `.beads/metadata.json` contains deprecated `dolt_server_port`.
- A stale Dolt `sql-server` process is holding the local `.beads/dolt` lock.
- `.beads/dolt-server.port` / `.beads/dolt-server.pid` are missing or stale.

### Deprecated `dolt_server_port` is dangerous

`dolt_server_port` in `.beads/metadata.json` is deprecated and can cause cross-project data leakage or stale-port failures. The active server port should come from `.beads/dolt-server.port`, managed by `bd`.

Observed Vibesync recovery pattern:

1. Remove only `dolt_server_port` from `.beads/metadata.json`.
2. Identify the stale Dolt process by working directory, not by port alone:
   `pwdx <pid>` should point at the affected project, for example `/opt/stacks/vibesync/.beads/dolt`.
3. Stop only that project-specific stale process.
4. Run `bd list --json` or `bd dolt status --json` and let `bd` recreate managed pid/port files.
5. Verify with `bd list --json` and `bd dolt push`.

### Container/runtime needs both `bd` and `dolt`

Vibesync’s container previously had `/usr/local/bin/bd` but not `/usr/local/bin/dolt`, so Beads hydration worked only until Dolt-backed stores needed Dolt operations. The production compose runtime should mount both binaries read-only:

```yaml
- /usr/local/bin/bd:/usr/local/bin/bd:ro
- /usr/local/bin/dolt:/usr/local/bin/dolt:ro
```

### Use Vaultwarden-backed credentials for DoltHub

Do not put `DOLTHUB_API_TOKEN` in `.env`. Use the Vaultwarden-backed compose wrapper so the token exists only for the `docker compose` invocation.

## Required preflight before working in any Beads-backed project

Before claiming or closing issues in a project, run these checks from that project directory:

```bash
test -d .beads
bd list --json
bd dolt status --json   # for Dolt-backed stores
bd ready --json
```

If running through Vibesync/containerized hydration, also verify:

```bash
docker exec vibesync which bd
docker exec vibesync which dolt
```

Check metadata directly only for shape, not for data mutation:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json
from pathlib import Path
p = Path('.beads/metadata.json')
data = json.loads(p.read_text())
print(data)
assert 'dolt_server_port' not in data
PY
```

Do not read or mutate `.beads/dolt` internals directly. Use the `bd` CLI.

## Fleet-wide port ownership audit

When more than one project reports repeated `.beads/issues.jsonl` auto-imports,
empty `bd list` output, or a port-in-use error, run the registry audit before
repairing projects one by one:

```bash
bun scripts/preflight/bd-registry-audit.ts --drift-only
bun scripts/preflight/bd-registry-audit.ts --json --drift-only
```

The audit uses `VIBESYNC_DB_PATH` when set and otherwise defaults to the service
database at `logs/sync-state.db`; pass `--db /path/to/sync-state.db` for an
explicit registry snapshot.

The audit enumerates registered Vibesync projects and classifies any project
whose `.beads/dolt-server.port` is owned by a different project's Dolt process
as `port-owner-conflict`. This uses the same `/proc/<pid>/cwd` verification as
`bd-preflight`, so the reported owner PID, owner cwd, expected project, and
expected cwd are the source of truth for remediation.

Safe fleet repair policy:

1. Fix `port-owner-conflict` rows first; they can cause writes to target the
   wrong empty database and repeatedly re-import JSONL.
2. Never kill a Dolt process by port alone. Confirm the owner cwd from the audit
   or with `readlink -f /proc/<pid>/cwd`.
3. Stop only the stale/wrong owner process after confirming it is unrelated to
   the project being repaired.
4. From the intended project directory, run `bd list --json` or
   `bd dolt status` so `bd` restarts that project's server and rewrites managed
   `.beads/dolt-server.port` / `.beads/dolt-server.pid` files.
5. Re-run both `bd-preflight` for the repaired project and
   `bd-registry-audit --drift-only` for the fleet.
6. Only after ownership is clean, address lower-risk categories such as
   `no-dolt-remote`, legacy pre-migration stores, and registry path drift.

If a project still conflicts after restart, assign it a free port using bd's
normal Dolt/server configuration path and let `bd` own the resulting port files;
do not manually edit `.beads/dolt` contents.

For centralized allocation, use the fleet repair helper. It defaults to dry-run
and chooses free ports from VibeSync's high allocation range (`32000-60999`):

```bash
bun scripts/preflight/bd-fleet-port-repair.ts --json
bun scripts/preflight/bd-fleet-port-repair.ts --project letta-mobile --apply
```

The helper applies changes only through supported `bd` commands:
`bd dolt set port <N>`, `bd dolt start`, then `bd-preflight` verification.

### Shared-server port ownership must match the project

A valid `.beads/dolt-server.port` file is not enough: the port may be
listening because a different project's Dolt server owns it. When that happens,
`bd` can appear to serve an empty database, repeatedly auto-import
`.beads/issues.jsonl`, or fail `bd dolt start` with a port-in-use error.

`scripts/preflight/bd-preflight.ts` now checks the listening process for the
configured port and compares `/proc/<pid>/cwd` with the expected project Dolt
data directory. A mismatch is reported with the owner PID, inferred owner
project path, actual cwd, expected path, and recovery guidance.

Safe recovery remains bd-managed:

1. Confirm the owner with the preflight report before stopping anything.
2. Stop only the stale owner whose cwd is known and unrelated to the target
   project.
3. Restart or re-run `bd` from the intended project so it starts the correct
   Dolt server.
4. Repair registry/config drift if the path mismatch reflects a moved project
   or a HOME-shadowed shared-server directory.

Do not manually edit or delete `.beads/dolt` contents to resolve a port
collision.

## Migration batches

### Batch A: already Dolt/server-backed, verify and harden

These projects already have local `.beads/dolt` plus `metadata.json` with `backend=dolt` and `dolt_mode=server`. They still need preflight, ownership, and remote verification.

### Batch B: legacy SQLite / mixed stores, migrate or classify as placeholder

These projects have `.beads` but do not currently present the clean Dolt/server metadata shape. Some are placeholder paths from Huly sync and may not deserve full migration.

## Recommended migration order

1. Add/ship preflight diagnostics in Vibesync so agents can see unsafe Beads state before touching a project.
2. Harden high-issue Dolt/server projects first: LTSEL, SFMCP, HDMCP, letta-mobile, LETTA, GRAPH, beads.
3. Classify Batch B into real projects vs placeholder-only stores.
4. Migrate real Batch B stores to Dolt/server mode with preserved `issues.jsonl` and verified `bd list --json`.
5. Resolve Batch C registry drift by correcting paths, initializing Beads, or disabling tracker advertisement.
6. Verify DoltHub remotes and push state for migrated projects.
